<!-- To create a link in HTML, we use the anchor element. An anchor element is defined by wrapping the text or another HTML element we want to be a link with an <a> tag. -->

   <a href="https://github.com/Piyush096"target="_blank">GITHUB</a>
   <!-- a is a anchor tag and >in between this we can write which shows on websites and link is added on that< -->
   <br>
   <a href="hhtps://google.com"target="_blank">google</a>

   <!-- here (target="-blank") is used to open that link in a new window -->
   <br>
   <a href="/day_5.html"target="_blank">day_5</a>

   <!-- By default, any text wrapped with an anchor tag without a href attribute will look like plain text. If the href attribute is present, the browser will give the text a blue color and underline it to signify it is a link.here as day_5 text looks on the browser as href attribute is present in this  -->

<!-- There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg". -->
