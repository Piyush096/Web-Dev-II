<!DOCTYPE html>

 <!-- Every HTML page starts with a doctype declaration. The doctype’s purpose is to tell the browser what version of HTML it should use to render the document. The latest version of HTML is HTML5, and the doctype for that version is simply <!DOCTYPE html>.  -->

<html lang="en">

    <!-- lang specifies the language of the text content in that element. This attribute is primarily used for improving accessibility of the webpage. It allows assistive technologies, for example screen readers, to adapt according to the language and invoke correct pronunciation. -->
    
<head>

    <!-- The <head> element is where we put important meta-information about our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser. Inside the <head>, we should not use any element that displays content on the webpage. -->

    <!-- SEO means Search Engine Optimization and is the process used to optimize
    a website's technical configuration, content relevance and link popularity so
    its pages can become easily findable, more relevant and popular towards user
    search queries, and as a consequence, search engines rank them better.  -->
